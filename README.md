Hello World ! 

It is the phrase that programmers display when they want to check if their code is working.  
You call noone in particular but also everybody to inform them about your progress.  
First of all, yourself :slightly_smiling_face:   

And sometimes, the world says hello back.

It feels like this sentence is directed to no one and no one
is watching, but writing this sentence for the first time 
really makes you feel like the world says hello back. And that feeling
can't be explained in words. You have to experience it yourself.
So fellow-programmer: give it a try ;).
